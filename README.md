Night Writer
======

* **Background:**
The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon’s army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille’s development of his Braille tactile writing system.

* **Learning Goals:**
The goals of this project were to break down a program into logical components, test those componenets in isolation and in tandem, apply Enumerables in a real context, and read text from files and write text to files.
